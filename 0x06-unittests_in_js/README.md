# 0x06. Unittests in JS
## Description
This project focuses on writing and understanding unit tests in JavaScript using tools like Mocha, Chai, and Sinon. The primary goal is to write efficient and effective tests that validate the functionality of various parts of a Node.js application.

## Learning Objectives
- Write test suites using Mocha.
- Use Chai for assertions.
- Implement spies and stubs using Sinon.
- Understand and use hooks for setting up and tearing down tests.
- Write unit tests for asynchronous functions.
- Perform integration testing with a small Node.js server.
